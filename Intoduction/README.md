6.  Build projects, commit to GitHub, organize your README file, add a live link to your website. (Deploying it on the internet)

7.  The MERN stack is great, but we still need to know containerization and auto-scaling (things we will learn in DevOps)

8.  DevOps Responsibilities typically include automating processes, managing and deploying code, monitoring performance, ensuring security, and enabling continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. DevOps professionals work with tools for containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) and cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) to enhance scalability, efficiency, and reliability of software applications.
